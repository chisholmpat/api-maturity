    <p>Before you can behing using this tool you must either <a href="#add_client"> create a new client </a> or
        be added as a user for an existing user. If you have already created a
        client then please visit either <a href="#/{{categoryIDs.API}}/clients"> API Maturity</a> or
        <a href="#/{{categoryIDs.BMIX}}/clients">Bluemix Affinity</a>to start a
        new assessment.</p>

    <p ng-if="role == 'admin'">If you've been granted admin priviledges then you are able to add and remove
        users from the application, change the wording of questions and create
        new forms. Any changes you make to these questions or forms will be reflected
        across all already existing clients so if you've been granted admin priviledges,
        use them wisely.</p>

    <h2> API Maturity Instructions </h2>

    <h3>When to Use</h3> 
    
    <p>Client wants to assess existing or new API Strategy and whether it is ready
    to pursue an APIs as a provider, consumer, business, or market.</p>

    <h3>How to Use</h3>

    <p>1. Each tab there is a series of questions that help determine where a customer
        is on the maturity curve for that enterprise dimension. First you will
        give the customers a series of API Characteric questions along with some
        deeper interview questions to help them think about their current API dynamics
        and the customer responses should be documented. You will rate the customers
        response on a scale of 0 to 5 gaining consensus on the score of course.
        This score is primarily from the customers perspective advised by you the
        assessor but it is used as a quantitative measurement.
        <ul>
            <li>0 Don't do it</li>
            <li>1 Planned</li>
            <li>2 In progress</li>
            <li>3 Partially Implemented</li>
            <li>4 Complete (Mature)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        2. Then you will give the customer a self assessment API Maturity for the enterprise
        dimension under discussion. This is the customers view only without any
        commentary or guideance other then to explain what it means to be mature
        in that API characteristic for that enterprise demension. The customer
        will rate themselves on a scale of 0 to 3 and it is their self-assessed
        rating.

        <ul>
            <li>0 Novice</li>
            <li>1 Progressing</li>
            <li>2 Mature</li>
            <li>3 Partially Implemented</li>
            <li>4 Complete (Mature)</li>
        </ul>
